Title: About

This site is about mostly ignored hotel spaces, the corridors, hallways and staircases. They bridge the humming public space of reception, lobby or bar and the privacy of the hotel room. Most people ignore these corridors when heading to or from their room, trying to pass by as fast as possible. This space is often viewed as a purely functional piece of the hotel.

However, upon closer inspection, it reveals a beauty of its own beyond pure functionality. Being very similar and quite different at the same time, hotel floors have their very own atmosphere. The long hallways with lots of doors or staircases connecting different floors expose a unique mix of lights, colors and structure. Have a look at the differences and similarities and see how hotel floors look like across a range of hotels.

This site is purely for-fun and non-profit.
